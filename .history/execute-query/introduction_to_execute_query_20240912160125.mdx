The Execute Query View is a powerful feature designed to simplify the process of running SQL queries across multiple databases in the system. This view allows users to execute complex queries on one or more databases simultaneously, leveraging custom queries or pre-built templates. This capability is essential for database administrators who need to gather insights or make changes across multiple environments in an efficient manner.

By offering the ability to select databases, run queries, and view the results in a tabbed format, the Execute Query View streamlines the workflow for database management. It eliminates the need for manual execution of queries on individual databases and enables users to analyze data from multiple sources concurrently.

One of the standout features of this view is the ability to save queries as templates. Users can either create new queries or choose from predefined templates to perform common tasks such as identifying poor index usage or tracking schema drifts. This template functionality ensures consistency and saves time, especially when running recurring queries across different databases.

In the following sections, each image attached to this documentation will be explained in detail, including how it relates to the Execute Query View and its features.
