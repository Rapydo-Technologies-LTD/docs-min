## Execute Query View

1. Full Query Interface (file: full.jpeg)

This image shows the main interface of the Execute Query View. Key elements include:

	•	Selected Instances: At the top of the screen, the user can select one or more databases (e.g., demo-db, xtra-demo-instance-01, etc.). This allows the query to be executed across multiple databases at once.
	•	SQL Query Editor: Users can type or paste their SQL queries directly into the text box. In this example, a query is created to examine row usage and index efficiency. This query can be run immediately or saved as a template for future use.
	•	Templates Section: Below the query editor, commonly used templates are displayed (e.g., Schema Drift, View User Privileges, Poor Index Usage). These templates help automate repetitive query tasks and reduce the need for manual input.
	•	Execute/Cancel Options: Users can execute the query on the selected instances or cancel the operation if needed.

This screenshot shows the SQL code used to identify full table scans across the selected databases. The query helps database administrators find inefficient queries that examine large numbers of rows unnecessarily, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.

This image demonstrates the result set for a Full Table Scan. Key columns include:

	•	SUM_ROWS_EXAMINED and SUM_ROWS_SENT: These columns show the number of rows examined and sent by the query.
	•	DIGEST_TEXT: This column captures a summarized version of the SQL statement executed, offering insight into the query type.
	•	RECOMMENDATION: Here, users can view recommendations for optimizing index usage or improving query efficiency.

The results are presented in a clean tabular format, making it easy to analyze the performance of the query across different database instances.

### Top Bar: Summary of Key Database Metrics

The top bar presents an overview of the key metrics across all databases connected to the system. It includes:

- **CPU Usage:** Displays the maximum CPU utilization percentage among the databases.
- **Available RAM:** Shows the maximum amount of available RAM for the connected databases.
- **Connections:** Shows the maximum number of active connections across databases.
- **Duration:** Shows the maximum session duration.
- **Users:** Displays the number of active users for the database with the highest activity.
- **Locks:** Indicates the number of database locks on the most utilized database.
- **Databases:** Displays the total number of databases in the system.
- **Hosts:** Shows the number of hosts running databases.
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):** Displays the IOPS for the database under the highest load.

This bar gives a quick snapshot of overall system performance.

### Configured Databases Table

The table presents all the currently configured databases along with the following details for each:

- **DB Identifier:** The unique identifier or name of the database.
- **Engine:** The database engine in use (e.g., MySQL).
- **Engine Version:** The version of the database engine.
- **Size:** The instance size of the database (e.g., db.t3.medium).
- **Cluster Identifier:** If applicable, shows the identifier for the database cluster.
- **Status:** The current status of the database (e.g., available, stopped).
- **Has Rapydo:** Displays whether Rapydo, the system's monitoring tool, is installed on the database (Yes/No).

Administrators can use this table to monitor all the databases currently connected to the system and assess their state.

### Configuration View: Database Connections

This section allows administrators to connect new databases to the system. It presents the list of databases that are available for connection and those that are already configured. Administrators can check off the databases they want to add to the system.

This view also enables administrators to review and update the list of databases being actively monitored, ensuring that the system always has the latest database connections.

### Configuration Modal: Database Authentication

When adding new databases to the system, the **Configuration Modal** prompts the user to provide their Amazon RDS credentials. This includes:

- **Username:** The admin or master username for the database.
- **Password:** The corresponding password for the database.

These credentials are encrypted and used solely for configuring new databases in the system. The modal ensures secure integration of new databases by verifying authentication details before they are added to the system.
