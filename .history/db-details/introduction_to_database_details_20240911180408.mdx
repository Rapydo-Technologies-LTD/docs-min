**Database Details Overview**

**Purpose of the Database Details**

Database Details is aimed at ensuring the following objectives:

+ Proactive Monitoring: Continuously track the health and performance of your database, including resource usage, query performance, and user activity. This enables administrators to identify and resolve issues before they escalate.
+ Real-Time Insights: Data on the dashboard is updated in real-time, allowing for immediate awareness of potential issues such as resource bottlenecks (e.g., CPU or memory overload), slow-running queries, or excessive database locks.
+ Efficient Resource Management: By visualizing metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, IOPS, and connection limits, DBAs can manage system resources more effectively, ensuring optimal allocation based on current workload.
+	Performance Tuning: The data provided enables detailed performance analysis, allowing for query optimization, identification of resource-intensive processes, and fine-tuning of database parameters to improve overall efficiency.
+	Error and Anomaly Detection: The dashboard highlights critical events like deadlocks, query throttling, unhealthy connections, and failed caching operations, helping to detect and address anomalies that could lead to downtime or performance degradation.
+	User and Client Activity Tracking: The dashboard provides visibility into user activity, helping administrators understand user behavior and optimize the system to handle current or future user loads effectively.
