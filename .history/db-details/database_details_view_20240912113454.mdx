### 2. Configured Databases Table

The table presents all the currently configured databases along with the following details for each:

- **DB Identifier:** The unique identifier or name of the database.
- **Engine:** The database engine in use (e.g., MySQL).
- **Engine Version:** The version of the database engine.
- **Size:** The instance size of the database (e.g., db.t3.medium).
- **Cluster Identifier:** If applicable, shows the identifier for the database cluster.
- **Status:** The current status of the database (e.g., available, stopped).
- **Has Rapydo:** Displays whether Rapydo, the system's monitoring tool, is installed on the database (Yes/No).

Administrators can use this table to monitor all the databases currently connected to the system and assess their state.

### 3. Configuration View: Database Connections

This section allows administrators to connect new databases to the system. It presents the list of databases that are available for connection and those that are already configured. Administrators can check off the databases they want to add to the system.

This view also enables administrators to review and update the list of databases being actively monitored, ensuring that the system always has the latest database connections.

### 4. Configuration Modal: Database Authentication

When adding new databases to the system, the **Configuration Modal** prompts the user to provide their Amazon RDS credentials. This includes:

- **Username:** The admin or master username for the database.
- **Password:** The corresponding password for the database.

These credentials are encrypted and used solely for configuring new databases in the system. The modal ensures secure integration of new databases by verifying authentication details before they are added to the system.
