### Introduction

In the current era of data-centric operations, ensuring peak database performance and robust security is essential for delivering uninterrupted user experiences and avoiding expensive system failures. The exponential growth of applications and their associated data volumes presents significant hurdles for developers and database administrators in efficiently managing database operations.

A potent answer to these challenges comes in the form of automatic user-defined rules implemented in Amazon RDS MySQL through Rapydo. These adaptable rules offer comprehensive management across various facets of database operations, encompassing performance enhancement, security reinforcement, and resource optimization. By initiating precise actions in response to specific triggers, these rules play a crucial role in upholding Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitments, bolstering security protocols, and streamlining overall database administration.  

### Understanding User-Defined Rules in Rapydo for Amazon RDS MySQL

Rapydo's user-defined rules for Amazon RDS MySQL are conditions and actions that allow for proactive database management. These rules can be triggered by various events and can execute a wide range of actions in response.

Rapydo rules abilities are divided into four sections, making it easy for the user to define and understand them:

## Automation Rules Modules

### Scout Rules
These rules are derived from a module which is installed as a standalone machine that aims to monitor the system from a broad point of view and can offer both real time machine metrics and handle access to the databases.

### Cortex Rules
These rules are derived from a module also called Rapydo’s proxy. This module is located inline between the database and the user’s application. This module focuses mainly on the SQL data that passes through it and can modify in real time all the relevant parameters of the query, connection and users.

### Cache rules
These rules are a part of Rapydo’s proxy cache module and can decide in real time if a query should be cached or if a cache invalidation is required.

### Alert Rules
These rules are a part of the Scout module which keeps track of the machine metrics among other things. The Alerts can be derived both from a change in the machine utilization or the database utilization.
