### Pie Chart View

For a more graphical representation, the pie chart view breaks down query statistics into visual segments, making it easy to digest the proportional impact of different queries on your system. This can be particularly useful for presentations and quick assessments during team meetings or reports.

### Table View

This view presents a detailed tabulation of ongoing queries and processes, providing specifics like query text, start time, execution duration, and more. Advanced filtering options let users sort and filter this data by various metrics, such as duration, to quickly isolate long-running or resource-intensive queries.
