**Dashboard Overview**

This Database Observability and Caching Dashboard provides a centralized, real-time view of key database performance indicators and caching efficiency metrics. Its primary purpose is to empower database administrators (DBAs), system architects, and developers to monitor and maintain the health, performance, and stability of the database infrastructure. The dashboard displays critical performance data, user activity, and system health, enabling users to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues, optimize query performance, and manage resources effectively.

The dashboard is designed to deliver a comprehensive understanding of how different aspects of your database system interact, making it easier to pinpoint inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and potential failures before they impact application performance or user experience.

**Purpose of the Dashboard**

The dashboard is aimed at ensuring the following objectives:

+ Proactive Monitoring: Continuously track the health and performance of your database, including resource usage, query performance, and user activity. This enables administrators to identify and resolve issues before they escalate.
+ Real-Time Insights: Data on the dashboard is updated in real-time, allowing for immediate awareness of potential issues such as resource bottlenecks (e.g., CPU or memory overload), slow-running queries, or excessive database locks.
+ Efficient Resource Management: By visualizing metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, IOPS, and connection limits, DBAs can manage system resources more effectively, ensuring optimal allocation based on current workload.
+	Performance Tuning: The data provided enables detailed performance analysis, allowing for query optimization, identification of resource-intensive processes, and fine-tuning of database parameters to improve overall efficiency.
+	Error and Anomaly Detection: The dashboard highlights critical events like deadlocks, query throttling, unhealthy connections, and failed caching operations, helping to detect and address anomalies that could lead to downtime or performance degradation.
+	User and Client Activity Tracking: The dashboard provides visibility into user activity, helping administrators understand user behavior and optimize the system to handle current or future user loads effectively.

### Time Range

This widget displays the time range for the data represented in the graphs and metrics. In this case, it is set to show performance and activity from the last 3 / 6 / 12 / 24 / 48 hours. This can be adjusted based on the user's needs.

### DB Instances

This widget displays the number of active database instances, idle instances, and stopped instances (0). Monitoring the state of instances helps in resource management and ensuring the right databases are running based on the current load.

### User Activity

Displays the current number of active users versus idle users. Active users are those interacting with the system, while idle users have not performed any significant activity recently.
High idle user counts with low activity might indicate a need for session timeout adjustments or inactive user clean-up.

### DB Connection Health

This widget shows the number of healthy and unhealthy database connections. Unhealthy connections could be due to network issues, resource constraints, or connection errors.
Investigate unhealthy connections to avoid system downtime or performance issues.

### Query Average Time

This widget shows the average query execution time across all database instances over the selected time range. It provides insight into the performance of the queries being run and can help identify slow-running queries.

### Longest Query

Displays the time taken by the longest-running query during the selected time range. This metric helps in identifying potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the system.

### Deadlocks

This shows the number of deadlocks encountered in the database. Deadlocks occur when two or more queries block each other, preventing further execution. This is a critical metric for ensuring the smooth operation of the system.
