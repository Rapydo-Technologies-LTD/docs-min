**Why Query throttling is Essential for Database Performance?**

As modern databases scale to handle increasing volumes of data and users, the number and complexity of queries they process concurrently grow exponentially. In many environments, particularly those serving high-traffic applications or multi-tenant systems, query overloads can quickly lead to performance bottlenecks. Resource-heavy queries can consume vast amounts of CPU, memory, and I/O, degrading the overall database performance and even causing crashes or downtime.

One common example of resource-heavy queries involves the use of the sql_calc_found_rows clause in MySQL. This clause forces the database to calculate the total number of rows in a result set before applying any LIMIT clauses to the query. While this can be useful for pagination or reporting, it comes with a cost—every row that matches the query conditions must be examined, regardless of how many rows the client actually retrieves. In environments with large tables, this can cause severe strain on database resources.

Query throttling becomes a critical tool to mitigate the impact of these resource-intensive operations. By controlling the rate at which queries are processed, throttling ensures that the database doesn’t become overwhelmed, maintaining overall system stability and performance. Without throttling, multiple simultaneous heavy queries could compete for limited resources, leading to slower response times or even complete unavailability of the database.

Moreover, throttling is particularly important in high-traffic applications where many users may be issuing similar types of queries. By intelligently limiting how many of these queries are allowed to execute at once, administrators can ensure a smoother and more predictable user experience, especially during peak loads.
